### A blog that critiquing products that I bought or experienced

Main idea is going around that my criticizing skills. I can find any points that "meh I do not like" on bought products.

One day; when I'm tweeting, said to myself "Why do not I'm writing a blog about products and their bad points??"

**IYKYK, everyone has a instinct based on this idea...**

## Getting Started
### What you need?
 
- A **Contentful** account and the keys that you can find on ```.env.example```
- React and Next skills

### How to run?

- Just go to terminal and type
```shell
pnpm install && pnpm run dev
```

### Gonna develop
- **Top critized of month side** 
- **Categories side**
- Vercel pipeline for production.
- Logging side to Firebase.
- Better **Headless CMS**(Because Contentful made me sick about interfacing post types. Their docs are too outdated.)

### Notes
I'm using Node 20.13.1(LTS) and PNPM for npm packages on this project. But it depends on your interests.
